                <p>
                I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for more than just coding. My love for animals and the outdoors is a big part of who I am. Away from the computer, I enjoy exploring nature and volunteering with animals. These interests keep me grounded and inspire my work in technology.

Balancing screen time with outdoor activities helps me stay creative and adaptable. Caring for animals has taught me empathy and patience. I believe these qualities are just as important in the tech world as they are in nature. I bring this balanced approach to my professional life, aiming to create tech solutions that are both innovative and user-friendly.
